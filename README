LONG GRB

broadbandnu1.00e14obs0d60.txt

Off-axis models that are good to represent the case of a long bright
GRB: dataset ''broad-band long GRBs in ISM'', which corresponds to a
GRB of jet energy 2e51 erg, expanding in a uniform ISM medium of
density 1 cm^-3, select a frequency of 1e14 Hz (the closest to the
R-band central frequency among the ones available in this repository),
and an off-axis observer angle of 0.30 rad and 0.60 rad. The simulated
dataset has an assumed GRB opening angle of 0.2 rad.  The dataset
gives time in day, and fluxes in mJy at a distance of 1e28 cm.

Off-axis models that is good to represent the case of a long
low-luminosity GRB: dataset ''broad-band and off-axis low-energy
GRBs'', which select select a GRB of jet energy 1e50 erg, a uniform
ISM medium of density 1 cm^-3, a jet angle of 0.2rad, a frequency of
4.56e14 Hz (for R-band), and an off-axis observer's angle of 0.40 rad
and 0.80 rad.  The dataset gives time in day, and fluxes in mJy at a
distance of 1e28 cm.

SHORT GRB

sgrbEjets1e50n1e-3thetajet0d2opticaltheta0d80.txt

Off-axis models that is good to represent the case of a short GRB:
dataset ''broad-band and off-axis low-energy GRBs'' in the online
repository select a GRB of jet energy 1e50 erg, select a uniform ISM
medium of density 1e-3 cm^-3, select a frequency of 4.56e14 Hz (for
R-band), a jet angle of 0.2 rad, and an off-axis observer's angle of
0.40 rad and 0.8 rad. The dataset gives time in day, anf fluxes in mJy
at a distance of 1e28 cm.

130603B_2thj_r.txt
130603B_4thj_rSDSS.txt

Off-axis models which use the intrinsic estimated properties of the 
on-axis GRB 130603B (Stratta et al. in prep) for an obsever angle twice
the beaming angle and 4 times the beaming angle.
